            3. Construct, implement, and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, analysis, and assessment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, assessments, or troubleshooting procedures.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Research, document, test, and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques, or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements that pertain to information security.
